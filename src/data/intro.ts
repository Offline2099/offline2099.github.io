  'If you are looking at this page, you have probably seen one of my websites and found yourself curious to see more. Or maybe you are already looking at my resume and considering hiring me for your project.',
  'I know how to build clean, well-functioning apps and websites. I like my work, and I can talk about it for hours. But words alone are not very convincing, so here are some quick examples of what I can do. Anyone interested can just check it out and decide whether it fits their expectations and quality standards.',
  'For a web developer, especially a freelancer, it is not a trivial task to build a reliable portfolio. People pay for their new website, then their business fails for whatever reason, and they shut it down after a year. All the work disappears, sometimes without a trace. In addition, web interfaces or dashboards are often made only for internal use within a certain company.',
  'To combat this annoying issue, I mostly rely on using my personal projects as a proof of competence. This way I can also be sure that no unexpected changes will appear in those apps, no legal restrictions or NDAs will apply, and no questionable design ideas implemented by others will be attributed to me.',
  'Here you can see a number of mini-projects, created mostly for the demonstration purposes. I will likely keep adding more of such examples to this list later. For each project, there is a GitHub repository link available. Enjoy having a look.'
