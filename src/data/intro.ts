  "If you are looking at this page, you have probably seen one of my projects and found yourself curious to see more. Or maybe you are already looking at my resume and thinking whether you should hire me for your team.",
  "First of all, this is a place where I can easily share something interesting that I've made. Quite often, there's an idea or a concept that I want to test in practice and show to other people. Not all such ideas make it into a complete app, but those which turn out rather well usually end up here.",
  "Also, these projects serve as a mini-portfolio, or some initial proof of competence. Even though most are rather too simple to fully demonstrate a developer's skill, it gives some basic understanding of what to expect. A GitHub repository link is available for each project, so anyone interested can dive into it and see whether the code meets their expectations and quality standards.",
  "I enjoy building clean, well-functioning apps and websites. There's something really satisfying about writing neatly structured code and turning an idea into a working app. I hope you will also enjoy taking a look at the examples listed here and find it worthy of your time."
